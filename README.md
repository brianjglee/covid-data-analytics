This project was my first forey into creating a database, and uploading, exploring, and visualizing data. 
I used Docker to create a container for mysql. Then using Azure Data Studio, I established a connection to the container.
Using SQL queries, I created a database and two tables for my covid deaths and covid vaccinations. I used bulk upload to transfer data from csv files to these tables.

For my data exploration, I focused on looking at how infection rates, death rates, and vaccinations changed over time per location. 
I made use of aggregate functions, CTEs, and views to assist in doing so. 

Finally, I extracted my tables into excel, connected to them in Tableau, and created a visualization of COVID deaths and infections over time. 
Thanks for taking a look!
